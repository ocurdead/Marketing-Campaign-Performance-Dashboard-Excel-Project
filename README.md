# 📊 Marketing Campaign Performance Dashboard
## Data Analytics Portfolio Project


# 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a paid marketing campaign dataset to evaluate performance, cost efficiency, and return on ad spend (ROAS).
An interactive Excel dashboard was developed to monitor key business metrics, identify loss-driving segments, and highlight optimization opportunities.
The objective was to move beyond surface-level metrics and assess overall profitability at campaign and ad group levels.

# 🎯 Business Objective

1. Measure campaign effectiveness using revenue, cost, and conversion metrics.
2. Identify high-cost, low-performing ad groups.
3. Evaluate overall profitability.
4. Provide actionable insights for marketing optimization.

# 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains campaign-level and ad group-level performance data including:

1. Month
2. Ad Group
3. Impressions
4. Clicks
5. CTR (Click-Through Rate)
6. Conversions
7. Conversion Rate
8. Cost
9. CPC (Cost per Click)
10. Revenue
11. Sale Amount
12. Profit & Loss (P&L)

# 📊 Key KPIs Evaluated

Total Sales: $12M+
Total Cost: $635K+
Conversion Rate: 10.38%
Cost per Conversion: 6.62
ROAS: 18.96x
Net Result: Overall Loss Identified

# 🔍 Key Insights

This project involved structured exploratory data analysis (EDA) and metric engineering on marketing campaign data to assess performance efficiency and profitability dynamics. Derived metrics including ROAS, cost per conversion, and contribution margin were computed to evaluate cost-adjusted performance at both campaign and ad group levels.
Despite strong revenue output and a ROAS of 18.96x, margin decomposition analysis revealed negative contribution from specific mobile-focused segments due to elevated acquisition costs. The analysis highlights the importance of cost-normalized evaluation over surface-level engagement metrics.

The framework developed in this project can be extended toward:

1. Predictive modeling of campaign profitability
2. Budget optimization modeling
3. Conversion probability estimation
4. Cost-performance anomaly detection

This project demonstrates applied analytical reasoning, metric engineering, and structured performance diagnostics.

# 🛠 Tools Used
