# 📊 Marketing Campaign Performance Dashboard
## Data Analytics Portfolio Project


# 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes multi-month marketing campaign data to evaluate performance, cost efficiency, and overall profitability. An interactive Excel dashboard was developed to monitor key metrics including revenue, cost, conversion rate, cost per conversion, and return on ad spend (ROAS).
The primary objective was to move beyond surface-level engagement metrics and assess whether the campaign generated sustainable financial returns. Through structured aggregation and segment-level analysis, the project identified cost inefficiencies across specific ad groups that contributed to an overall net loss despite strong revenue performance.
The dashboard enables dynamic filtering by month and ad group, allowing performance comparison and profitability assessment across segments. This project demonstrates applied data analysis, KPI modeling, and business-oriented performance evaluation using Excel.

# 🎯 Business Objective

1. Measure campaign effectiveness using revenue, cost, and conversion metrics.
2. Identify high-cost, low-performing ad groups.
3. Evaluate overall profitability.
4. Provide actionable insights for marketing optimization.

# 🔍 Key Insights

This project involved structured exploratory data analysis (EDA) and metric engineering on marketing campaign data to assess performance efficiency and profitability dynamics. Derived metrics including ROAS, cost per conversion, and contribution margin were computed to evaluate cost-adjusted performance at both campaign and ad group levels.
Despite strong revenue output and a ROAS of 18.96x, margin decomposition analysis revealed negative contribution from specific mobile-focused segments due to elevated acquisition costs. The analysis highlights the importance of cost-normalized evaluation over surface-level engagement metrics.

The framework developed in this project can be extended toward:

1. Predictive modeling of campaign profitability
2. Budget optimization modeling
3. Conversion probability estimation
4. Cost-performance anomaly detection

This project demonstrates applied analytical reasoning, metric engineering, and structured performance diagnostics.

# 🛠 Tools Used
